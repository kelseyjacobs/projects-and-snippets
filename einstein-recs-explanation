Hello Kelsey,

After testing with the provided emails and Data Extension, I found that the recommendations being returned are blank. I then looked into how Einstein is processing the logic, and it appears there are two separate issues depending on which email and logic set we're reviewing.

Starting with the email titled "Shorts Only Tags and Rule" using the logic "Shorts_Only_withRules": This logic is configured to waterfall through multiple scenarios, such as Bought Bought Last Cart, Favorite Tag, Top Sellers, etc. Each of these scenarios in Einstein is powered by lists that are generated based on your catalog and user behavior data. I'll provide a link to the outlines below.

Some of these scenarios, like Bought Bought Last Cart, rely on individual subscriber data. For example, the Bought Bought Last Cart scenario returns items based on the last item added to a user’s cart. If a subscriber doesn’t have the necessary behavioral data, Einstein will attempt to move on to the next scenario in the sequence.

Other scenarios, like Top Sellers, are based on broader site data. These lists are curated by Einstein and include a limited number of products. You can view them in Salesforce Marketing Cloud by navigating to Email Recommendations > Reporting > Admin Tools > Lists > search 'TopSellers' (no space). When I searched this list, I wasn’t able to find any products with "shorts."

Einstein processes recommendations in a specific order: It first filters based on your catalog and available products, then builds out the scenario lists, and finally applies any rules you’ve configured. In your case, the rule 'Include Items Where ProductName contains "Shorts"' is applied after the scenario list is built. So if none of the items in the list match the rule, Einstein will remove them — resulting in no recommendations being returned.

Next, I reviewed the second email and logic combination: "Shorts_Only_Tags". This logic is using the tag path Tag > Women > Clothing. That approach would work if your shorts are tagged accordingly. However, when I searched the list associated with tag_women_clothing (Reporting > Admin Tools > Lists), I found only three products — and none of them were shorts.

If the list generated by the tag contains items where the ProductName includes "Shorts," then Einstein will successfully populate the recommendation block with those products. However, if no matching products are found in the list, the rule will filter everything out.

To summarize, there are two main issues contributing to these recommendations:

The scenarios being returned don't include shorts because "shorts" aren’t present in the scenario lists.

The rule is filtering out any items that don’t match the criteria, and if nothing remains after filtering, no recommendations are displayed.

To resolve this, you could update the tag in your logic scenario to point to a category or tag value that reliably includes your shorts products. This is typically the most straightforward way to ensure the correct items appear in your Recommendation block. You may also want to review your tag configurations and confirm that the expected products are being categorized correctly.


Please let me know if you have any questions and I'd be more than happy to help!
